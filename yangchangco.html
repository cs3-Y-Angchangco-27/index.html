					<h2> written by: Yumi Alessandra F. Angchangco </h2>
				<h3> I catch your eyes and get reminded <h3>
				<h3> I hadn't felt the same as before <h3>
				<h3> the starry night sky when i first saw you <h3>
				<h3> Unexpected heart aches from thinking of you more <h3>
				<h3> So much memories sweet like honeydew <h3>
				<h3> During December when New years was nearly due <h3>
				<h3> But really my new years was nothing new <h3>
				<h3> because after all it would always be you <h3>
